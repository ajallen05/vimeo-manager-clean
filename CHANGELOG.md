## Changelog

### [2024-12-19] - Bug Fixes and Dependencies Update

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed lucide-react source map error**: Resolved build failure caused by corrupted source map file in `node_modules/lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/wine.js.map`
  - **Root Cause**: Corrupted source map file was causing ESBuild to fail during development server startup
  - **Solution**: Performed clean reinstall of all dependencies by removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then running `npm install`
  - **Impact**: Development server now starts successfully without build errors

- **Fixed metadata export authentication error**: Resolved 401 authentication errors when exporting video metadata to Excel
  - **Root Cause**: Export functionality was using incorrect credentials source (environment variables instead of memory storage)
  - **Solution**: Updated `server/export-routes.ts` to use `storage.getActiveCredentials()` instead of `getVimeoCredentials()` from credentials.ts
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Changed import from `{ getVimeoCredentials } from "./credentials"` to `{ storage } from "./storage"`
    - Updated credentials retrieval to use `await storage.getActiveCredentials()`
    - Added proper error handling for missing credentials
  - **Impact**: Metadata export now works correctly with proper Vimeo API authentication

- **Fixed download links in metadata export**: Resolved broken download URLs for videos, thumbnails, and captions in Excel export
  - **Root Cause**: Export was generating URLs for non-existent API endpoints

    - Updated `getVideoDownloadInfo` function in `server/export-routes.ts` to generate correct URLs
  - **Impact**: All download links in metadata export now work properly and point to functional endpoints

- **Fixed 404 errors for API endpoints**: Resolved frontend router interference with API download endpoints
  - **Root Cause**: Vite middleware was catching all requests including API routes and serving frontend HTML instead
  - **Solution**: Updated Vite middleware to exclude API routes from frontend processing
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Modified `server/vite.ts` to skip `/api/` routes in development middleware
    - Updated production static serving to exclude API routes
    - Added proper API error handling for missing endpoints
  - **Impact**: Download links in Excel now work correctly without 404 errors

    - Added `target="_blank"` for better redirect handling
  - **Impact**: Downloads now auto-start immediately, work universally, and don't require server resources

- **Fixed JSON parsing error in download functionality**: Resolved "Unexpected token DOCTYPE" error when server returns HTML instead of JSON
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend was trying to parse HTML error pages as JSON when server was down or returning errors

  - **Solution**: Updated endpoint to fetch and return actual caption content from Vimeo text tracks
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Modified `/api/videos/:videoId/captions.txt` endpoint to fetch text tracks from Vimeo API
    - Added logic to find default caption track or use first available track
    - Fetch actual caption content from Vimeo's caption link
    - Proper error handling for videos without captions
  - **Impact**: Caption downloads now provide actual subtitle/caption content instead of "[No description]"

- **Fixed missing metadata in exports**: Resolved issues with tags, description, duration, and file size showing incorrect values in Excel/CSV exports
  - **Root Cause**: Duration was being converted twice (once in getVideoDetails, once in export) and file size had similar double conversion
  - **Solution**: Fixed data type handling and conversion logic for metadata fields
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Fixed duration handling to return raw seconds from Vimeo API instead of pre-converted minutes
    - Fixed file size handling to return raw bytes from Vimeo API for proper conversion in exports

    - Maintained proper conversion logic in export functions (duration to minutes, file size to MB)
  - **Impact**: Exports now show correct duration, file size, and handle tags/descriptions properly when available

- **Made thumbnail URLs auto-download in exports**: Changed thumbnail URLs in Excel/CSV exports to force download when clicked
  - **Root Cause**: Exports were using direct Vimeo image URLs which display the image in browser instead of downloading
  - **Solution**: Changed thumbnail URLs to use our API endpoint which sets proper download headers
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Updated `server/export-routes.ts` to use `/api/videos/:videoId/thumbnail` instead of direct Vimeo image URLs
    - Updated `server/routes.ts` CSV export to use the same auto-download endpoint
    - Maintained existing thumbnail endpoint logic that sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` header
  - **Impact**: Clicking thumbnail URLs in Excel/CSV exports now automatically downloads the thumbnail image file

- **Fixed bulk download ArchiverError**: Resolved "queue closed" error that occurred when clients disconnected during bulk downloads
  - **Root Cause**: Archive stream operations were being called after client disconnection, causing the archive to throw errors
  - **Solution**: Added proper client disconnection checks before all archive operations
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Added `!isClientDisconnected` checks before all `archive.append()` calls in download workers
    - Added early exit mechanism in download workers when client disconnects
    - Improved connection stability with additional headers (`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`)
    - Enhanced logging to track client disconnection events
    - Added double-check for client connection before starting each individual download
  - **Impact**: Bulk downloads now handle client disconnections gracefully without throwing archive errors

- **Improved bulk download frontend error handling**: Fixed "Failed to download videos" message appearing despite successful backend processing
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend was treating connection interruptions during streaming as complete failures, even when backend successfully processed downloads
  - **Solution**: Enhanced frontend error handling to distinguish between server errors and connection issues during streaming
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Modified error checking to only fail on explicit HTTP 4xx/5xx errors
    - Added graceful handling of blob parsing failures during streaming
    - Improved user feedback with informative messages about connection interruptions
    - Added checks for empty blobs and provided appropriate user guidance
    - Better error messages that distinguish between server failures and connection issues
  - **Impact**: Users now see appropriate success/warning messages instead of generic failure alerts when downloads complete successfully but connections are interrupted

- **Fixed thumbnail URLs to be universal**: Reverted thumbnail URLs in Excel/CSV exports back to direct Vimeo links for universal sharing
  - **Root Cause**: Previous fix made thumbnails use localhost API endpoints, creating URLs that only work when server is running locally
  - **Solution**: Reverted to direct Vimeo thumbnail URLs that work universally and can be shared anywhere
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Updated `server/export-routes.ts` to use `largestThumbnail.link` instead of localhost API endpoint
    - Updated `server/routes.ts` CSV export to use direct Vimeo thumbnail URLs
    - Maintained highest quality thumbnail selection logic
  - **Impact**: Thumbnail URLs in Excel/CSV exports are now universal Vimeo links that can be shared and accessed from anywhere

#### Thumbnail and Caption Cache Issue After Video Replacement
- **Issue**: When replacing a video, thumbnails and captions showed old content from original video
- **Root Cause**: Vimeo CDN and browser cache retained old thumbnail/caption files after video replacement
- **Solution**: Implemented cache-busting system for thumbnails and captions
  - Added version parameter support to thumbnail and caption endpoints (`?v=timestamp`)
  - Cache-busting headers (`Cache-Control: no-cache`) for forced refresh
  - Local storage tracking of replacement timestamps for each video
  - Updated frontend to use cache versions for recently replaced videos
  - Added force refresh button in video modal with cache invalidation
  - Export functions use timestamped URLs for fresh thumbnail/caption data
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Backend: `/api/videos/:videoId/thumbnail?v=xxx` and `/api/videos/:videoId/captions.txt?v=xxx`
  - Frontend: `localStorage` tracks `video-cache-version-{videoId}` after replacement
  - Automatic cache-busting in metadata table, video modal, and exports
- **Impact**: Thumbnails and captions now update immediately after video replacement, showing content from the new video

#### Global Cache Refresh for Legacy Replaced Videos
- **Issue**: Videos replaced before cache-busting system still showed old thumbnails and captions
- **Root Cause**: Previous video replacements had no cache version tracking, so cache-busting wasn't applied
- **Solution**: Added global cache refresh functionality accessible from video lists and metadata tables
  - "Refresh Cache" button in video table bulk actions
  - "Refresh Cache" button in metadata table header  
  - Applies current timestamp as cache version to ALL videos in the current view
  - Forces page reload to immediately apply fresh cache parameters
  - Works retroactively for any previously replaced videos
- **User Experience**:
  - One-click solution to fix all stale thumbnails and captions
  - Clear visual feedback with loading spinner and toast notifications
  - Automatic page reload ensures immediate visual updates
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `localStorage.setItem('video-cache-version-{videoId}', timestamp)` for all videos
  - Bulk cache version assignment for batch fixing
  - Integrated into existing video table and metadata table components
- **Impact**: Users can now fix thumbnails and captions for all previously replaced videos with a single button click
